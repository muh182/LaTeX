### Coupled "Transient Structure" and "CFD" Simulation
#### Liceasen Issue
The coupled simulation requires using two licenses (not the shared license). If the setup uses shared license, you will see the following error message:
`The shared license is not available to write the input file`. This link has some explanations about them:

**How to Fix it**
* Use the Set License Preferences for User option of the ANSLIC_ADMIN utility
* Specify which method to use and which licenses to use.
* Specify the licensing method before starting an ANSYS Workbench session. 

** Note: If you access the Licensing Preferences dialog box from the ANSYS Workbench Tools menu, you will not be able to choose a licensing preference from there.
